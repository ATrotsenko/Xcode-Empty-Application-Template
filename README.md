Xcode Empty Application Template
================================

In Xcode 6 onwards, the Empty Application template has been removed. This is a blow for us who still want and like to use xib files.

But no need to fret! It isn't difficult to add it back.


## Install

##### Manually
- Clone or download the repo. 
- Copy the `Empty Application.xctemplate` directory to the following location.

`{Xcode.app}/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/iOS/Application/`

- Restart Xcode.
